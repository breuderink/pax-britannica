In this file I (Boris Reuderink) document journey in the source of Pax

Today I read some of the Lua files. It seems that there is a very generic
engine written in C, and that the game is fully written in Lua. This makes
things --- I think --- much easier.

Also, the '--debug' argument is quite interesting; space speeds up the game,
and the keys Z, X, C, V can be used to quickly build without consuming
resources.

For future hacking, the logging and the_on_button files seems most interesting. Controlling the speed of time might be very interesting form the BCI POV.

The BCI client in C is in a working state (externally developed). So, the trick is now to:
1 duplicate the keyboard code,
2 add a new set of keys to see that it works,
3 add the mindplay c code, and recompile,
4 and finally, integrate the mindplay init and destroy calls,
5 and poll for high probability events, and assign a key press.
